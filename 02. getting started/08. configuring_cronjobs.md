# Configuring Cronjobs

Cronjobs are scripts that are designed to be called periodically, in Fork CMS they are mainly used to go through queued items like for example queued e-mails. They can be excuted either through commandline as well as over your webserver.

Without additional modules has Fork CMS two cronjobs:

Commandline:

```
php http://mydomain.com/src/Backend/Cronjob.php?module=Core&action=ProcessQueuedHooks

php http://mydomain.com/src/Backend/Cronjob.php?module=Core&action=SendQueuedEmails
```

Webserver:

```
/usr/bin/wget -O - --quiet --timeout=1440 "http://mydomain.com/backend/cronjob?module=Core&action=ProcessQueuedHooks"
/usr/bin/wget -O - --quiet --timeout=1440 "http://mydomain.com/backend/cronjob?module=Core&action=SendQueuedEmails"
```

Some additional modules need extra cronjobs, check the details page on your modules overview to see which cronjobs need to be set for the module.

When setting cronjobs on servers with several Fork CMS installation try to spread the execution by changing the minutes parameter.
