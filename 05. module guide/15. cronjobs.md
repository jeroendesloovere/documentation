# Cronjobs

If a certain action needs to be executed at a certain interval (ones a day, hour, â€¦) you'll be defining a cronjob. The first thing you have to do, is write a cronjob action. For our example we want an action that sends the administrator, ones a week, the overview of the most awesome blog_posts.

## Action

Just as with an Ajax-action, you'll make an action file but located in the Cronjobs folder of your module. Mind that in contrast to ajax-files, this is *always* in the modules folder in the backend!
Our class extends `BackendBaseCronjob`.

```
namespace Backend\Modules\MiniBlog\Cronjobs;

use Backend\Core\Engine\Base\Cronjob as BackendBaseCronjob;
use Backend\Modules\MiniBlog\Engine\Model as BackendMiniBlogModel;
use Backend\Core\Engine\Model as BackendModel;
use Backend\Core\Engine\Language as BL;

class SendMostAwesome extends BackendBaseCronjob
{
    public function execute()
    {
        $this->setBusyFile();

        // get all top awesome items
        $items = BackendMiniBlogModel::getTopAwesome();
        $str = '';
        // create a link for each item containing the title and #awesomeness
        foreach ((array)$items as $item) {
            $str .= '<p><a href="' . SITE_URL . $item['full_url'] . '">' .
                $item['title'] . ' (' . $item['awesomeness'] . ')</a></p>';
        }
        $variables['data'] = $str;

        // build our message
        $to = BackendModel::getModuleSetting('Core', 'mailer_to');
        $from = BackendModel::getModuleSetting('Core', 'mailer_from');
        $replyTo = BackendModel::getModuleSetting('Core', 'mailer_reply_to');
        $tpl = BACKEND_MODULES_PATH . '/MiniBlog/Layout/Templates/Mails/Send_top_awesome.html.twig';

        $message = \Common\Mailer\Message::newInstance(
            BL::msg('NotificationAwesomeness'))
            ->setFrom(array($from['email'] => $from['name']))
            ->setTo(array($to['email'] => $to['name']))
            ->setReplyTo(array($replyTo['email'] => $replyTo['name']))
            ->parseHtml(
                $tpl,
                $variables,
                true
            );
        $this->get('mailer')->send($message);

        $this->clearBusyFile();
    }
}
```

### Busy?

The first line of code you'll see is the `setBusyFile` method. This creates a temporary file that exists as long as the action is executing. At the end of the executing the action, the file is deleted with the `clearBusyFile` method.

You'll use cronjob often for quite intensive tasks that might take a while. To avoid an action being executed while the previous execution is not yet finished, the busy file is used as a check.

> **Not executing anymore?**
> When you're developing sometimes, you'll probably write code that generates an error. When this happens while testing a cronjob action, the busy file is created but never deleted because the clearBusyFile-line is never reached. This causes all further executions of the cronjob to fail because setBusyFile thinks that the previous run of the file is not completed yet.
>To solve this problem, go to /src/Backend/Cache/Cronjobs/ and delete the existing busy-files.

## Executing

Before you install the action as a cronjob you'll want to test it manually. You'll do this by calling the following url:

```
/src/Backend/Cronjob?module=MODULENAME&action=ACTIONNAME
```

## Problems when coding

When coding cronjobs you should not use one of the following functions, because they are going to break your cronjob:
- BL::getWorkingLanguage()
- BackendModel::createURLForAction()

This comes because the cronjob doesn't know what the current language is and these functions use that language.
